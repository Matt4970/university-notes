# Phase
Uniform circular motion is exactly as it sounds. Something moving in a circle at a constant speed. When we compare this to simple harmonic motion we will be able to see that one component of the motion is exactly the same.

In these images both the simple harmonic motion and the uniform circular motion systems have a nearly identical vertical component when they are oscillating.

In order to measure the phase of the uniform circular motion system we would draw a line horizontally through the system and the angle between that line and the rod towards the mass would indicate the phase. As the mass rotates in a full circle the phase goes all the way from zero to 2pi.

That's how we can measure the phase of a simple harmonic motion using an angle and it is why we have an alternative frequency known as angular frequency which is:
$$ w = 2\pi f $$
Expressed in units of radians per second.

$$ sin(\theta) = cos(\theta - \frac{\pi}{2}) $$

These demonstrate that simple harmonic motion is really just a one dimensional projection of uniform circular motion.
