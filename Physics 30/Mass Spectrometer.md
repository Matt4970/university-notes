# Mass Spectrometer
A mass spectrometer can be used to:
- **Separate** ions of different mass.
- Determine the **mass** of an ion.
- Determine the **charge-to-mass ratio** of an ion.

There are three main parts to a mass spectrometer.
1. Accelerator (uses an electric field).
2. Velocity Selector (uses electric and magnetic fields).
3. Separator (uses a magnetic field).

#### Velocity Selector
Charged particle through **electric** and **magnetic** fields. Uniform Motion since there are two balanced forces.

#### Separator
Charged particle through a magnetic field. Circular Motion since there is **one magnetic** force that causes circular motion.
