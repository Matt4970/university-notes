# Fields
Fields are the areas of influence that cause forces.
See [[Physics 30 Formulas#Electricity and Magnetism]]

## Electric Fields
The direction of an electric field is defined as the direction a proton would move in if it were placed in the field. So for protons the force that the proton experiences and the direction of the electric field are the same. For an electron the direction of the field and the force it experiences are in opposite directions. 
**Be careful not to confuse Force and Field.**

$$ |\vec E| = \frac{kq}{r^2} $$

The electric field is magnitude only and when it comes to (q) use the charge that is creating the field and make sure to use the absolute value for the charge.

$$ \vec E = \frac{\vec F_e}{q} $$

In this formula the q is the charge that is creating the field.

## Gravitational
$$ |\vec g| = \frac{Gm}{r^2}$$
Mass creating the field.
$$ \vec g = \frac{\vec F_g}{m} $$
Mass experiencing the field.

## Examples
### Electric Field Direction
An electric field causes an electron to accelerate to the west. What direction is the electric field in?
Answer: East

### Charged Particle between Two Parallel Plates
A charged particle (object 1) is placed between two parallel plates as shown below. What is the charge of object 1? What does arrow 2 represent? What does arrow 3 represent?

Answers:
1. It has a negative charge (electron).
2. Electric Field
3. Electric Force

### Two Charges are Placed in an Electric Field
The electric field direction is to the left and charge 1 experience a force to the left while charge 2 experiences a force to the right. What are the charges of charge 1 and 2?

Answer: Charge 1 is positive and charge 2 is negative.

### Electric Field Strength in the Middle of Two Charges
Two charges are separated by a distance of 20 cm. One has a charge of +2.0 uC and the other a charge of +4.0 uC. What is the magnitude of the electric field strength at the midway point between the two charges?

Answer: $$ 1.8*10^6 N/C $$
