# Momentum
**#Momentum** is the product of an object's mass and velocity.

 $$ \vec{p} = m\vec{v}$$
kg • m / s is typically used for momentum.

# Impulse
**#Impulse** may be defined as a change in momentum. 
 $$ \Delta{p} = p_{f} - p_{i} $$
N • s is typically used for impulse. 

N • s is equivalent to kg • m / s.
