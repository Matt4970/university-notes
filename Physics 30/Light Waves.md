# Light Waves
The universal wave equation and the period-frequency relationship apply to light waves.

$$ v= \lambda f $$ 
$$ c= \lambda f $$
$$ T = \frac{1}{f} $$

# Michelson's Speed of Light
A system of rotating mirrors allowed for a precise measurement of the speed of light.

The observer sees the light at **1/8 of a rotation** if the wheel rotates at the proper frequency. The wheel becomes the timer.
Multiple reflections allow for a shorter separation distance.
