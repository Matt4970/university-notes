## Newton's Laws of Motion
### Newton's First Law
An object at rest stays at rest and an object in motion stays in motion with the same speed and in the same direction [unless acted upon by an unbalanced force](http://www.physicsclassroom.com/Class/newtlaws/u2l1d.cfm#balanced).

### Newton's Second Law
The acceleration of an object as produced by a net force is directly proportional to the magnitude of the net force, in the same direction as the net force, and inversely proportional to the mass of the object.
$$ a = \frac{F_{net}}{m} $$
But it's easier to remember when it is rearranged to the below form.
$$ F_{net} = mâ€¢a $$

### Newton's Third Law
When two bodies interact, they apply forces to one another that are equal in magnitude and opposite in direction.

## General Laws

### Law of Conservation of Momentum
The total momentum within a system is constant.
Momentum is conserved when objects within a system interact.
An interaction is typically a collision or explosion.

### Law of Conservation of Charge
Charge is neither created nor destroyed, it can only be transferred from one system to another.

### Law of Conservation of Energy
Energy can be neither created nor destroyed. It can only be converted from one form to another.
