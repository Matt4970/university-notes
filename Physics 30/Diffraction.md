# Diffraction
**Diffraction** is the spreading out of a wave as it passes through an opening.

Waves diffract but particles do not.
When it comes to the  visible light spectrum red will deviate from it's original path the most during diffraction while violet will deviate the least. It is the opposite for refraction.
# Double Slit Diffraction
Where the lines overlap constructive interference occurs.

# Diffraction Grating
A **diffraction grating** is an optical component that diffracts light into several beams traveling in different directions. It does this by having many slits close together for waves to diffract through.

# Examples
## Light is Incident on a Pair of Slits
The slits are 1.75 um apart. The maxima are measured to be 28.6 cm apart and the screen is located 1.08 m away from the double slits. What is the wavelength  of the light used?

Answer: 448 nm
Tip: If the diffracted angle is greater then ten you have to use the other formula. Always check the angle.
