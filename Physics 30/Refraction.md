# Refraction
**Refraction** is the change of direction as a wave travels from one substance to another. So if the angle of incidence and angle of refraction are both the same then refraction has not occurred.

## Snell's Law
**Frequency** does **NOT** change during refraction. Only wavelength, velocity and angle change.

## Critical Angle
When light goes from a high refractive index to a low refractive index and the angle of incidence is equal to the critical angle then the angle of refraction will be 90 degrees.

## Total Internal Reflection
This occurs when the angle of incidence is greater then the critical angle.

# Examples

Answer: 35 degrees.
Tip: Always use the angle between the wave and the normal line.
