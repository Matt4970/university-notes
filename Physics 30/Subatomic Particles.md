# Subatomic Particles
Common subatomic particles along with their relative charge.

| Subatomic Particles    | Relative Charge | Charge              |
| ---------------------- | --------------- | ------------------- |
| Electron $$ (e^-) $$   | 1-              | $$ -1.6*10^{-19} $$ |
| Proton $$ (p^+) $$     | 1+              | $$ +1.6*10^{-19} $$ |
| Neutron $$ (n) $$      | 0               | 0                   |
| Positron $$ (e^+) $$  | 1+              | $$ +1.6*10^{-10} $$ |
| Alpha $$ (\alpha^{2+}) $$ | 2+              | $$ +3.2*10^{-19} $$ |                       |                 |                     |

A **positron** is the antimatter particle of an electron; it has identical rest mass and charge magnitude. (It is an electron with a positive charge.)
An **alpha particle** is made from two protons and two neutrons.
