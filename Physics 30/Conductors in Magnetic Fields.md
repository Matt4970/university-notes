# Summary
A force is exerted on a current carrying wire inside a magnetic field.

A moving charge creates a magnetic field. If the charged particle passes through an external magnetic field the two fields may interact to product a force on the particle.

The magnitude of the magnetic force on a current carrying conductor is given by the #Force_BIL equation.
$$ F_m = IL_⟂B $$
Where
- *Fm* is the magnetic force acting on the wire (N)
- *B* is the magnetic field strength (T)
- *I* is current through the conductor (A) (Amperes have base units of C / s)
- *L*⟂ is the length of the conductor perpendicular to the magnetic field (m)

# Examples
## Wire Placed between Two Magnetic Poles
A wire is placed between two magnetic poles. The wire is attached to a battery and electrons flow into the page as shown in the diagram. A vector arrow is used to indicate the direction of the magnetic field between the poles and force acting on the wire.

## Calculation for Magnetic Field Strength
A 30 cm long copper wire has a mass of 40 g and is carrying a current of 5.0 A at right angles to a uniform magnetic field. This apparatus is placed in a strong magnetic field and the wire is found to levitate. Calculate the magnetic field strength.

The magnetic field strength must be 0.26 T.
