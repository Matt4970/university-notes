# Mirrors

**Positive** mirrors **converge** light rays. **Negative** mirrors **diverge** light rays.

The distance and height of the image will always have opposite signs. Negative distance and positive height means that it is **virtual**. Positive distance and negative height means that the image is **real**.

## Curved Mirror Equations
The characteristics of an image in a mirror can be found algebraically using the following equations.
$$ \frac{1}{f} = \frac{1}{d_o} + \frac{1}{d_i} $$
$$ m = \frac{h_i}{h_o} = \frac{d_i}{d_o} $$

| Distance (d)                     | Height (h)        |
| -------------------------------- | ----------------- |
| Real Focal Points or Images +    | Upright Images +  |
| Virtual Focal Points or Images - | Inverted Images - |

All **real** images are inverted and all **virtual** images are upright.

# Examples
## Image Produced by Converging Mirror
The image produced by a converging mirror will always be:

A. Smaller than the object.
B. Larger than the object.
C. Virtual if the object's distance is greater than the focal length.
D. Virtual if the object's distance is less then the focal length.

Answer: D

# Summary
|         | d image | h image |
| ------- | --------- | ------------------- |
| Real    | +         | - (Inverted)        |
| Virtual | -         | + (Right Side Up)   |
