# The Photoelectric Effect
Light energy changes to electrical energy. Provides evidence that light is a particle.

| Manipulated           | Responding                    |
| --------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| Intensity of EMR      | Current (Number of Electrons) |
| Frequency of EMR      | Energy Kinetic of Electrons   |
| Metal (Work Function) | Energy Kinetic of Electrons   | 

All of this only happens when **past** the threshold frequency.

Every photoelectric effect calculation may start with this LOCOE statement.
$$ E_{photon} = E_{k_{max}} + W $$

# Stopping Voltage
Voltage required to stop a charged particle from moving across parallel plates.
Useful for determining the particle's energy and speed.
$$ E_{k_{max}} = qV_{stop} $$

Where:
E is the energy of emitted electrons (J).
q is the charge on an electron (c).
V is the voltage required to stop (turn back) the electron.

## Photoelectric Effect Explanation Question
The photoelectric effect may be nest explained that light:

A. Must obey the law of conservation of energy.
B. Travels at the speed of light.
C. Must be treated as a wave.
D. Must be treated as a particle.

Answer: D.

## Voltage needed to Stop an Electron
What is the potential difference required to stop an electron having a kinetic energy of 300 eV?

Answer: 300 V.
Tip: When using eV, the Energy Kinetic is numerically equivalent to the Stopping Voltage.

## Stopping Voltage needed to reduce the Current to Zero
Light with a wavelength of 470 nm is directed on a photoelectric surface having a work function of 1.40 eV. What is the stopping voltage needed to reduce the current through the cell to zero?

Answer: 1.24 V.
