# Summary
The magnetic field of a moving charged particle will interact with external magnetic fields to exert a force on the particle.
The velocity of the particle and the magnetic field must be perpendicular to each other to maximize the magnetic field produced.

The magnitude of the magnetic force on a moving charged particle is
$$ F_m = qv_⊥B$$
Where
 - *Fm* is the force action on the wire (N)
 - *B* is the perpendicular magnetic field strength (T)
 - *q* is the charge on the moving particle (C)
 - *v⊥* is the speed of the particle perpendicular to the magnetic field (m/s)

# Examples
## Proton and Magnetic Field
A proton is traveling due west when it enters a magnetic field that is towards the south. Determine the direction of the magnetic force on the proton.

The direction of the magnetic force is upwards. 
## Electron entering a Magnetic Field Calculation
An electron is accelerated from rest across a potential difference of 20 000 V. It then enters a magnetic field of 60 mT that is perpendicular to the direction of the electron's path. Determine the electron's radius of curvature in the magnetic field.
