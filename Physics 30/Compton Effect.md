# Compton Effect
The Compton Effect is explained based on light being a mass-less **particle** that has momentum. 

It provides evidence that light behaves as a **particle** (photon) not a wave.
$$ p = \frac{h}{\lambda} $$
$$ E = pc $$
For these formulas use units involving J.

# 2-D Compton Collisions
Compton scattering equation:
![[Compton Scattering Example.png]]

$$ \triangle \lambda = \frac{h}{mc} (1-cos \theta) $$
$$ \triangle \lambda = \lambda_f - \lambda_i $$
Use Joules per Second of Planck's constant.
Theta is the angle between the initial and final wavelength path.
For mass use the mass of an electron (kg).

# Examples

## X-Ray Scattering
An X-ray scatters at an angle of 40.2 degrees. What is the wavelength of the scattered X-ray photon?

Answer: $$ 6.56*10^{-11} m $$
