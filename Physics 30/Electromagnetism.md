# Electromagnetism
Oersted discovered that a current through a wire produces a magnetic field **circling** the wire.
Magnetic field strength (B) is measured in units of tesla (T).
Magnetic field vectors must be described in three dimensions. Vector convention for arrows into or out of a page:
- Arrow directed into the page is shown with an X
- Arrow directed out of the page is shown with a â€¢

Solving Electromagnetism questions will involve a... *smacks lips* healthy knowledge of [[Hand Rules]].
