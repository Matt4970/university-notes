# Quantum
The energy for a single **particle of light** (photon) is given as:

$$ E = hf $$
$$ E = \frac{hc}{\lambda} $$

E is the energy of a photon.
h is Planck's constant.

For waves brightness would be the amplitude of the waves. Whereas for particles their brightness would be linked to the amount of particles. The more particles there are the brighter the beam is.

Major concepts are the [[Photoelectric Effect]] and the [[Compton Effect]]. A summary of them can be found directly below.

# Summary

Evidence for EMR being a particle and a wave.

| Wave       | Particle             |
| ---------- | -------------------- |
| Diffracts  | Photoelectric Effect |
| Interferes | Compton Effect       |
| Polarization           |                      |

Diffraction and interference was determined from Young's double slit experiment.

Even though energy must be either a wave and or a particle (mutually exclusive) we must accept that it is both.
