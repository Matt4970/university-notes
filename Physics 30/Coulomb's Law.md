# Coulomb's Law
Coulomb's Law describes the net electrostatic forces between two objects. See [[Physics 30 Formulas#Electricity and Magnetism]].

$$ |\vec F_e| = \frac{kq_1q_2}{r^2} $$

Magnitude only when in reference to the force and use absolute values when it comes to the charges (q).
Determine whether it is a repulsive or attractive force after by looking at the charges of the objects. (Opposites attract.)
Electrostatic force and the distance between two objects have an **inverse** relationship.

# Example
### Two Identically Charged Objects
They are placed at a distance "r" from each other and exert a force of repulsion on each other. What changes will result in the electrostatic forces remaining the same?

Answer: Both charges are **doubled** and the distance is also **doubled**.

### Two Point Charges Produce an Electrostatic Force of Attraction
The force of attraction is 5.5x10^-3 N. Determine the magnitude of the electrostatic force produced if the charge on each object is doubled and the distance between them is tripled.

Answer: 2.4x10^-3 N.

Solution:
$$ |\vec F_a| = \frac{k2q_12q_2}{3r^2} $$
$$ |\vec F_a| = \frac{4}{9}(5.5*10^{-3}) $$
$$ |\vec F_a| = 2.4*10^-3  $$
