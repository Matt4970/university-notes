# Collisions
![[Laws#Newton's Third Law]]

In all collisions the forces are always **equal** but **opposite**.
That means that the #impulse experienced by both are always **equal** but **opposite**.
$$ \Delta{p} = -\Delta{p} $$
$$ \Delta{p} = \vec{F}\Delta{t} $$
$$ \vec{F}\Delta{t} = m\Delta\vec{v} $$
$$ F = ma $$
$$ p_i = p_f $$

As the stopping **time increases** the stopping **force decreases**.

Momentum before = momentum after in all collisions.

![[Laws#Law of Conservation of Momentum]]

### Isolated System
An isolated system does not interact with anything outside of the system. No external forces are exerted. No energy is gained or lost.
Momentum is always conserved and kinetic energy is only conserved if the collision is elastic.

### Elastic Collision
A collision is elastic when the total kinetic energy before is the same as the total kinetic energy after the interaction (collision, explosion, etc). Only subatomic collision come close to being perfectly elastic.

### Inelastic Collision
Kinetic energy before is greater than the kinetic energy after.
Breaking, crumpling or bending during a collision is empirical evidence of an inelastic collision.
Whenever two objects collide and stick together the collision is completely inelastic.

## Examples
### Compressed Spring
Two masses are connected by a compressed string. On the left side of the spring is a 10 kg mass and on the right side is a 5 kg spring. When the spring is released the force on the large mass will be **equal** to the force on the smaller mass. However the acceleration that the smaller mass experiences will be **greater than** that of the larger mass.

 ### Collision between a Small Car and a Large Truck
 A large truck collider with a small car. The force of the truck on the car is **equal** to the force of the car on the truck. The acceleration on the truck will be **less than** the acceleration of the car.

 ### Car Gradually coming to a stop compared to Ramming a Barrier
 A car slows down gradually and comes to a stop. A second identical car comes to a stop suddenly when it crashes into a barrier. The first car experience an **identical** #impulse compared to the second car.

 ### Summary of Above Examples
 A large truck collides head-on with a small car.
  - The force each exerted on the other will always be **equal and opposite**.
  - The #impulse experienced by each will always be **equal and opposite**.
  - The larger mass in the collision has the **smaller** acceleration.

### Total Momentum before and after a Collision
They are equal in magnitude and in the same direction. 
Forces and impulses are equal and opposite during a collision, **but** momentum is equal and in the same direction when comparing before the collision to after.

## Solving Collision and Explosion Questions
Use the LOCOM or components or a scale diagram. The slowest but most accurate way is just to diagram the mass, velocity and momentum of each object involved the collision or explosion before and after. It two variables are missing create an equation.
