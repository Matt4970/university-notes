## Magnetic Fields (B)
Magnetic fields are an attempt to explain the interaction of magnetic poles. It is the region where magnetic effects can be observed. Magnetic fields that are traveling in the same direction repel while opposite fields attract, it is consistent with how poles work in this fashion. This helps to explain the [[Motor Effect and Generator Effect]].

## Laws of Magnetic Poles
- There are two types of poles; **north** and **south**.
- Like poles repel.
- Opposites attract.

## Magnetic Field Direction
It is defined as the direction the north end of a compass needle points (i.e, towards a south magnetic pole). The compass needle acts as a **test object** to test the direction of the field. The magnetic field lines can be drawn as shown.

## Field Theory
| Field                | Source        | Direction              | Range    |
| -------------------- | ------------- | ---------------------- | -------- |
| Gravitational (N/kg) | Mass          | Attractive             | Infinity |
| Electrical (N/C)     | Charge        | Attractive & Repulsive | Infinity |
| Magnetic (T)         | Moving Charge | Attractive & Repulsive | Infinity         |


## Examples

### Compass
A small compass is placed next to a powerful magnet and the compass needle points at the magnet as shown below. The dark end of the magnet is it's north pole. The forces on the compass needle and the bar magnet are identical according to [[Laws#Newton's Third Law]].

### Charged Particle Moving Through a Magnetic Field
A charged particle (e.g., electron) turns in a circle inside a magnetic field.
The centripetal force is always perpendicular to the direction of the motion. Basically in order for the charged particle to turn in a circle the force has to be towards the center of the circle.

### Positron Traveling in a Circle within a Magnetic Field
A positron travels a circle inside a magnetic field as shown below. What is the direction of the magnetic field that is causing this motion?
