# Charging an Object
There are three ways to charge an object. Friction, Conduction or Induction.
Friction and Induction produce oppositely charged objects while conduction produces identically charged objects.

## Friction
Two objects are brought into contact and rubbed against each other. One of the substances has a greater affinity for electrons and becomes negatively charged. The other becomes positively charged. 

## Conduction
Charging via conduction involves the contact of a neutral object with a charged object. If a positively charged aluminum plate comes into contact with a metal sphere then that metal sphere will become positively charged as well. Happens due to the LOCOC.

## Induction
Charging by induction can be performed by repeating the following steps.
1. Bring a charged object close to a neutral object.
2. Ground the neutral object.
3. Break the ground.
4. Remove the charged object.

This will leave you with an object of opposite charge then the original charged object. For example if a positive ruler is brought near a grounded neutral electroscope electrons will be attracted to the ruler and flow into the electroscope. Then when the electroscope is no longer grounded the charge will remain. LOCOC makes this all possible of course.

## Electroscope
An electroscope is a scientific device that can be used to test for the presence of electric charge on an object.
