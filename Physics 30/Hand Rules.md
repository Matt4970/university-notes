## Hand Rules Summary
They are used to determine the electron flow, magnetic field direction and force. When dealing with **negatively charged particles the left hand is used** otherwise if we are dealing with **positively charged particles or a conventional current the right hand is used.** The same procedures are follow but the right hand is used to present different results.

## First Left Hand Rule for Straight Wires
- Thumb of the left hand points in the direction of electron flow.
- Fingers will wrap around the wire in the same direction as the magnetic field.

## Second Left Hand Rule for Coils
- Left hand grasps the coil.
- Fingers curl around the loops in the direction of electron flow.
- Thumb points in the direction of the North Pole of an imaginary bar magnet inside the coil.

## Third Left Hand Rule for Moving Charged Particles in Magnetic Fields
- Left thumb points in the direction of electron flow.
- Fingers indicate the direction of permanent magnetic field (south).
- The palm shows the direction of the moving electrons and the magnetic force that acts upon the electrons to make them move in that fashion.

# Examples
## Horizontal Wire
A horizontal wires current (electron flow) is to the right as shown in the diagram below. Determine the direction of the magnetic field on a point that is directly beneath of the wire.

Using a hand rule for electron flow, the magnetic field below the wire is directed out of the page. In the hand rule, the left hand represents the negative charge, the thumb represents the direction the electrons are moving and the direction the fingers coil around the wire represents the direction of the magnetic field circling around the wire.
