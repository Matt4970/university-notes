# Lenses

Light is redirected due to the **refractive index** (optical material) and **shape** of the lens.

All **real** images are inverted and all **virtual** images are upright.

**Positive** lenses **converge** light rays. **Negative** lenses **diverge** light rays.

The distance and height of the image will always have opposite signs. Negative distance and positive height means that it is **virtual**. Positive distance and negative height means that the image is **real**.

## Lens Graph

The Y-int is equal to the **inverse of the focal length** and the slope is equal to **-1**.

# Examples
## An Object is Positioned in near a Diverging Lens

A 50.0 cm tall object is positioned 1.0 m from a diverging lens having a focal length of 0.5 m. What is the height of the image and it's orientation?

Answer: 5.0 cm and Right Side Up.
