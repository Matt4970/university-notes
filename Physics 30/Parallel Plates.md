### Solving Parallel Plate Questions
Use energy for charged particles accelerating from one charged plate to another. Energy Potential is equal to Energy Kinetic when it is speeding up and vice versa for if it is slowing down.

### Solving Projectile Motion combined with Parallel Plates
Use a projectile motion calculation for the charged particles traveling perpendicular to the electric field and solve for time.

### Millikan Oil Drop
Millikan use charged drops of oil between two parallel plates to determine the elementary charge, the charge on the electron.
Gravitational forces get ignored on molecular or smaller objects but must be included for oil drop questions.

### Solving Millikan Questions
1. Draw a free body diagram.
2. Write the net force equation.

## Examples 
### Electron Accelerating Across Parallel Plates
An electron starts from rest and accelerates across two charged parallel plates. The voltage in between the plates is 1400 V. What is the maximum speed of the electron?

Answer: $$ 2.22*10^7 m/s $$

### Positron Entering Uniform Electric Field
A positron is moving when it enters a uniform Electric Field between two parallel plates and speeds up within the plates. What would be the best energy expression to represent the situation?

Answer: $$ E_{ki} = E_{kf} - E_{pi} $$

### Projectile Motion within Parallel Plates
An electron is traveling horizontally when it enters a vertical electric field and it begins to curve upwards. What is the charge of the top plate? What direction is the electric field?
