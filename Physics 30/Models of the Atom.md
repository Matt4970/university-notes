## Raisin Bun

J. J. Thomson using a cathode ray tube. It is also referred to as the plum pudding model.
The properties of a cathode ray are that it travels in straight lines and it is deflected by electric and magnetic fields. Therefore it is not EMR.

## Nuclear

Proposed by Ernest Rutherford by using a gold foil and scattering alpha particles.
When shooting alpha particles at a piece of gold foil most alpha particles went through without being deflected and a small number had their course altered but passed through anyway and a very small number were deflected back. He thought that the atom was mostly **empty** space. Electrons circle in the empty space around the positive nucleus.

## Quantized

Proposed by Niels Bohr by observing the light that was emanating from hot gasses (emission spectra). 
Electrons orbit the atom at certain allowed energy levels.

| Empirical (Observation)                  | Theoretical (Interpretation/Explanation)                      |
| ---------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Bright Line Spectra (Emission Spectra) | Electron transition down an energy level releasing a photon. |
| Dark Line Spectra (Absorption Spectra)   | An electron absorbs a photon and transitions up an energy level.                                                           |

## Cloud

Proposed by DeBroglie by observing the diffraction of electrons,

He suggested that since waves can act as particles, perhaps particles can act like waves. This is known as **Wave-Particle Duality**. Particles can act like waves and waves can act like particles.
