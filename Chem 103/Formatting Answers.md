# Significant Digits
Uncertainty: The inexactness of the measuring device and the need to estimate when taking a reading.

### Multiplication and Division
Pay attention to significant figures.

### Addition and Subtraction
Pay attention to the number of decimal places.
83.5 mL + 23.28 mL = 106.8 mL (not 106.78 mL)

### Logarithms
Answers have the same number of significant figures **after** the decimal place as there are in the number who's logarithm was taken.
pH = -log[H+] = -log 0.0**105** = 1.**979**

# Rounding
If the number before the 5 is odd round up. If the number preceding the 5 is even round down.

17.75 = 17.8
17.65 = 17.6

# Exact Numbers
An **exact number** has no uncertainty associated with it. Some exact numbers are part of a unit conversion: by definition, there are exactly 60 minutes in 1 hour, 1000 ug in 1 mg.
