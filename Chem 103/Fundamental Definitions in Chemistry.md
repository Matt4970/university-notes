## Properties of Matter
**Matter** is the stuff of the universe. It is air, glass, planets, students or anything that has *mass or volume.*

**Physical properties** are characteristics that a substance shows by itself, without changing into or interacting with another substance. There properties include melting point, electrical conductivity, and density.

**Chemical properties** are characteristics that a substance shows as it changes into or interacts with another substance or (substances). Chemical properties include flammability, corrosiveness, and reactivity with acids.

A **chemical change** (chemical reaction) occurs when one or more substances are converted into one or more different substance or substances.  

## States of Matter
A **solid** contains particles with low kinetic energy; this results in strong intermolecular forces between the atoms or molecules, causing the solid to have a fixed shape and a fixed volume that does not conform to the shape of the container. They are not defined by their rigidity or hardness.

A **liquid** contains particles with greater kinetic energy than the particles in a solid; there are weaker intermolecular forces between the atoms or molecules, allowing the liquid to conform to the shape of the container it is placed in. It's volume is fixed and depending on the gravitational force, a liquid may or may not have an *upper surface*.

A **gas** contains particles with a very high kinetic energy more than liquid. There are very weak intermolecular forces so if not contained it will spread indefinitely if left unconfined. Gases do not have a fixed volume and will conform to the shape of the container it is placed in.

A **plasma** contains particles with very high kinetic energy. It behaves very much as a gas does in that it fills the entire container and does not have a fixed volume. It is composed of a mixture of neutral atoms, electrons, and ions, although it has a **net charge of zero**. **Plasma** is significantly affected by electrical and magnetic fields and although it is not commonly encountered on Earth it is believed to be the most common form of matter in the universe.
