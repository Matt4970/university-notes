# Scalars
Scalars are quantities defined by a single number (i.e. mass, speed, area, temperature).

Scalars do not have a direction!

Since scalars are simple numbers, they follow the normal rules of arithmetic in mathematical operations.

# Vectors
Vectors are physical quantities defined by both a magnitude and direction. (i.e. velocity, force, moment, acceleration).

Vector operation follow the 'parallelogram rule of addition'.

- Since magnitudes are scalars, they are always taken as positive!
