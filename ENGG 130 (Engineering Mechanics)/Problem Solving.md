# Problem Solving

### Step 1: Problem Formulation.

**Ask:**
- What do I want to find?
- Which factors are significant? Which aren't?

**What can help?**
- Draw a diagram!
- Tabulate data.
- Select appropriate idealizations.

### Step: 2 Select Governing Principles
**Examples:**
- Newton's Laws
- Differential Equations
- Empirical equations from experiments.

This helps to identify the appropriate equations to relate the known to the unknown.

### Step: 3 Solve the Governing Equations

**How to solve?**
- Algebra, Calculus, Statistics, Graphs.
- May need to use a computer.

**In this course:**
- Use Gaussian elimination to solve systems of equations (i.e. restricted from using matrix methods).

### Step: 4 Check Your Answer

**Ask yourself if the solution makes sense!**
- Alternative solution techniques.
- Methods to estimate the answer?
- Example could be getting a negative number if you know the solution must be positive.
