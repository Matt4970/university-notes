# Three Branches to Engineering Mechanics
1. Rigid Body Mechanics
	- Statics
	- Dynamics
2. Deformable Body Mechanics
3. Fluid Mechanics

We focus on **Rigid Body Mechanics** for the Static Condition.
**Rigid Bodies:** The object we are interested in does not change shape under the force (no bending or breaking).
**Statics:** The object will remain at rest and will not accelerate.
